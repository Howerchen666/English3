        <h5 class="openStatus">This item is a review article about Apple 1—the company's very first product—written by R.S. Jonas. It was written in 1976, the year the Apple 1 computer was first introduced. Since this article thoroughly described the technical characteristics of the Apple 1, its intended audience would be technology enthusiasts or anyone with an interest in computers. Personally, I think this item is extremely important and is probably one of the most expensive things you could find in the early days of Apple in 1976. Since Apple only got launched in 1976, it would be difficult to gather any reviews from so early in the company's history. After reading this article, I would conclude that the author felt that there was no doubt about the company's long-term viability and that the review of the Apple 1 computer was generally favourable.

        <h5 class="openStatus">A leaflet from Apple promoting their Apple 1 computer is my second item. This flyer was made in 1976 and was designed by the Apple computer firm. This flyer's main purpose is to promote the company's product to computer enthusiasts or those who are considering buying a computer. This is yet another reasonably priceless item, because it is one of earliest Apple advertising that I am able to find. </h5>

        <h5 class="openStatus">A press release from Apple introducing the new iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max is the third item. This article was written by Renee Felton and Alex Kirschner. Apple employs both of the authors. This article was published on September 7, 2022, the same day those new products went on sale. The general population is the target audience. Considering that anyone nowadays may potentially become an Apple customer. Given that it is still relatively new and simple to obtain, this article might not be as important as the previous two items. The iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max are Apple's newest products, and the company is attempting to generate a lot of money from them, so it is still rather relevant.</h5>

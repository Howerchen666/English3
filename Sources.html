            <h5 class="organization-name">One of the research questions I generated during my major project was, “What caused Apple to shift its attitude towards customers customising their devices”.  Apple devices nowadays have a pretty lousy self-repairability. At the same time, their first-ever product - Apple I- was designed for computer enthusiasts, allowing users to easily make addons and modifications to their computers to make addons and modifications to their computers easily. To find out the answer to this question, I have chosen to create a worknet for the article “Taking a bite out of Apple: Jailbreaking and the confluence of brand loyalty, consumer resistance and the co-creation of value.” It is written by Michael SW Lee and Ian Soon. Jailbreaking is considered a type of customisation that users make to their devices which Apple highly oppose. This study explored the reason why users would like to jailbreak their devices, as well as the interesting love-and-hate relationship between Apple and Apple’s loyal customers.
                <br>
                <br>
                The worknet that I created has four distinct phases. The first phase is the semantic phase, which consists of the article's most important words or phases. I've chosen the keywords "brand loyalty," "jailbreaking," and "Apple" for this article. I chose these three keywords for a variety of reasons. To begin with, these three keywords appear the most frequently in the article. If a word or phrase repeatedly occurs in a report, it is said to be more critical to the article. Second, these three words express the article's main point. Reading these three keywords gives people a general idea of this article. These three words or phrases are also used in the article's title. The article's title highlights the main idea and indicates the author's writing purpose. These three words in the title would demonstrate the importance of these three keywords. Third, the keywords I chose are also included in the article's tags. The article's tags help people find the report using the search function. These tags would also display the article's leading and most essential ideas. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The second phase of the worknet is the bibliographic phase. The bibliography phase includes picking out the most important or exciting sources from the bibliography page of the article. The first bibliography I chose is an official article written by Apple on its official support page. Since this article is about the “invisible war” between Apple and its loyal customers, this source was selected mainly because it shows Apple's attitude. In the article, they thoroughly explained why they highly oppose the action of jailbreaking devices. The second article that I have chosen is “the verge” article. In this article, the author explained how App Store changes cut developers’ profits. As most people may know, when you purchase the Apps installed on your Apple devices using App Store payment, the total amount does not directly go to the App’s developers, instead when Apple receives the payment, they will take a cut of 15% or 30% depending on the yearly revenue of the App developers. Without jailbreaking, it is the only way to make purchases of applications on Apple devices. That has caused many app developers to feel unfair in this situation since whenever they get a payment from their customers, they will lose 15% or even 30%.
                On the other hand, jailbreaking raises an interesting scenario. By jailbreaking applications could now be installed through Cydia, people could choose other payment methods other than Apple’s 30% cut payment method. Therefore, it is hard not to question whether Apple is simply objecting to jailbreaking due to the loss of its profit or it is actually due to the reasons listed on its official support page.
                <br>
                <br>
                The third phase of the worknet is the affinity phase. In this phase, the article's authors or related authors are discussed. The first two authors that I have chosen to include are “Michael SW Lee” and “Ian Soon”.  They are the author of the article. Michael SW Lee’s name is written before Ian Soon in the author's section of the article. That means the contribution of Michael SW Lee has made a more significant contribution to this article. After reading through Michael SW Lee, I noticed that Michael SW Lee is an award-winning marketing senior lecturer at The University of Auckland Business School. He is the Director of The International Centre of Anti-Consumption Research, and his research interests include anti-consumption, brand avoidance, and consumer activism.
                On the other hand, Ian Soon is a University of Auckland Business School Bachelor of Commerce (Honors) alumnus focusing on marketing and management. Both authors are somewhat professional on this topic since this question belongs to their field of study. However, Michael is a bit more authoritative compared with Ian, since Michael is already a senior lecturer, whereas Ian is a graduate student. The third author I have chosen is “Apple Inc.” the Apple company. Apple was included in this worknet mainly due to two reasons. First of all, in the article's bibliography page Apple is the author that appears most frequently on the list. The more frequently an author appears on the bibliography page, the more important the author is to the article. Secondly, “Apple” is one of the most direct parties involved in the article's research question. By referencing Apple’s official articles, we would have a good idea of Apple’s attitude towards this issue.

                <br>
                The last phase of the worknet is the choric phase. During this phase, the events that happened during the period that the article is written are added into the worknet. It does not necessarily have to be directly related to the article, the authors, or anything. For this phase, I have chosen to add several nodes. The first two nodes are about what happened for Apple during the year 2017 - the year that this article was published. In the year of 2017, it was a big year for iPhone since it was the tenth year since iPhone was first announced. They released iPhone X, which features a complete redesign. For instance, touch ID is replaced with Face ID. The screen of the device has been changed to a bezel-less design. The naming of iPhone X was named due to the 10th year of the iPhone’s release, which also caused Apple to skip the iPhone 9. The second node I chose to include is the release of iOS 11. iOS 11 features various updates to accompany the newly released devices. For instance, the newly designed App Store, splitting screen on iPad, QuickType keyboard, etc. These two nodes are included because I want to give other people an idea of what Apple did in 2017. After all, Apple is the main focus of the article. The other two nodes that I chose to include are more general and zoom out of this article; it is just two major events that happened during 2017. The event is that Donald Trump was selected as the 45th President of the United States and the other node is “70 Years of Marriage for Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip”. Those two nodes were included simply because I believe those are two exciting facts/significant events that happened during 2017.

                <br>
                In conclusion, after creating this worknet, I have a general idea of “What caused Apple to shift its attitude towards customers customising their devices.” The reason behind this change is mainly due to Apple’s changed customer focus. Back in 40 years ago, their first product - Apple I, primarily targeted computer enthusiasts compared to nowadays; Apple’s product targets a more comprehensive range of customers. By disallowing customers to customize their devices or make changes could help to increase the stability of their devices, both hardware and software side. For instance, jailbreaking an iPhone would significantly decrease the stability of the device, and it is more prone to crashing. In a way, limiting jailbreaking or other types of customization would help Apple to maintain their premium brand image since it decreases the chances of customers making customizations and something going wrong and thinking it is Apple’s fault and damaging its brand image.
